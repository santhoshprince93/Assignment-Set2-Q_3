3.	If X1 ~ N(μ, σ2) and X2 ~ N(μ, σ2) are iid normal random variables, then what is the difference between 2 X1 and X1 + X2? 
Discuss both their distributions and parameters.   
Ans: As we know that if  X ∼N(μ1, σ1^2 ), and  Y ∼N(μ2, σ2^2 ) are two independent  random variables then   X + Y ∼N(μ1 + μ2, σ1^2 + σ2^2 ) , and   X − Y ∼N(μ1 − μ2, σ1^2 + σ2^2 ) .Similarly if  Z = aX + bY , where X and Y are as defined above, i.e Z is linear combination of X and Y , then Z ∼N(aμ1 + bμ2, a^2σ1^2 + b^2σ2^2 ).Therefore in the
